Dear <NAMEOFUSER>, we welcome open communication, discussions and sharing of ideas, which are directly linked to our project.

Due to the continuous abuse of the group by spammers we are now enforcing strict rules:

Do not share links. If you share a link, the message will be automatically removed by the bot, and you will be blacklisted.


Do not advertise token-sales. If you do this, the message will be removed by the bot and you will be blacklisted.


You can ask me the following questions:
